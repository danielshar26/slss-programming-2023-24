## Output
We can display text and symbols using output
We use the `print ()` function to display output
```python
print()
```

## Comments
Comments are pieces of texts that are NOT interpreted by Python
This means that the text is ignored
We use the # symbol to make comments

## Input
We grab information from the user using input()
It will wait for the user to type something in and press Enter/Return

```python
input()
inputprompt
```

# [Lists]
